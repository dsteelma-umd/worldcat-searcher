There he meets Juano, 17, an enigmatic, self-assured black-metal fan from the nearby pueblo, who opens his eyes to a new, liberating universe. As his country and family is heading for the abyss, the two boys budding friendship develops into a fragile romance and Juan Pablo is forced to define himself against his chaotic surroundings." ],
